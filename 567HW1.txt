Deliverable #3

What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
Nothing really, simple coding, plus I did this assignment last semester

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
I took SSW-564 with you so I know this isn't one of the beautifully in-depth and unambigious requirement documents we seek to emulate, but for a first assignment its good enough.  The one big problem I had with it is that it did not specify how much testing to do, so I stuck with the five simple tests I ran last year.

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
Again not too much, 

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
My personal criteria was having at least one test case for each output - ie one invalid triangle, one equilateral triangle, one right scalene triangle, etc.  But with hindsight I may have easily missed a few things with testing and could have had way more tests - how do i know that my program won't fail in a specific case that I didn't think of to test?
