What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
Nothing really.

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
The requirements are not 110% in-depth or unambigious, but for a first homework assignment its good enough to get the point across.  Two major problems i had with it were that (1) it did not define the different kind of triangles (i.e. what is a right triangle?) and (2) that it did not specify how much testing to do, so I ran only a few simple tests.

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
Nothing really, it was easy enough to figure out on my own.

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
My personal criteria was having at least one test case for each output - ie one invalid triangle, one equilateral triangle, one right scalene triangle, etc.  But with hindsight I may have easily missed a few things with testing and could have had way more tests - how do i know that my program won't fail in a specific case that I didn't think of to test?
